# Prediction using Supervised ML

Supervised learning is when the model is getting trained on a labelled dataset. A labelled dataset is one that has both input and output parameters. In this type of learning both training and validation, datasets are labelled.

## Problem Statement


1. Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.
1. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
1. You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
1. What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

## Solution

Simple Linear Regression is performed with the train-test-split technique for Machine Learning implementation. A scatter plot with the regression line is plotted. The value is then predicted for the variable given by the user to the model. At the end the Mean Absolute Error and R-squared score of the model is calculated.
