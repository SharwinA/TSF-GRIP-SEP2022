# Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

## Problem Statement
1. For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
1. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

## Solution
Decision Tree Classifier was used to classify the classes according to the right class. A tree plot was used to understand the structure of the Decision Tree algorithm. Random Test values were given to the model except for the data points from the dataset to predict the class. Accuracy score was used to provide the efficiency of the model.
